Clone-Censor-Weight Tutorial
===============

# Overview  

A series of codefiles and vignettes to assist collaborators with understanding the techniques for executing a target trial emulation where individuals are cloned and assigned to two or more treatment strategies, censored for non-adherence and weighted by the inverse probability of remaining uncensored.  

# Usage  

1) Run the `onetime.R` file initialize Renv package and install necessary packages.  
2) Run files in order, `01_*.R-0#_*.R)`.   

Select each vignette to explore an aspect of target trial emulation methods.  

# Vignettes  
Companion documents have been written to assist interested readers with the background and use of the package.  

  - Simulate data; Describes how to simulate a dataset for different estimation problems.
