A TTE need not be done use CCW, but the approach is popular due to its flexibility. This website is a tutorial meant to guide researchers and others in how to execute a CCW analysis.\n\nI provide some personal insight into the process, different approaches that can be done, and mainly focus on the analytical methods. In order to actually emulate a target trial, a researcher needs to understand the fundamentals of randomized, controlled trial (RCT) design, causal inference, probability statistics and their practical application with a statistical programming language. I do not go into detail on this.\n\nThe following readings are recommended for that background and to prepare for the tutorial guide.\n\n1)  For a full in-depth review of causal inference methods, I recommend Robins' and Hernan's [Causal Inference: What If](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/wp-content/uploads/sites/1268/2024/04/hernanrobins_WhatIf_26apr24.pdf).\n\n2)  [Randomized Controlled Trials](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369220304633?via%3Dihub) by Emily Zabor et al. provides background on RCT design. Randomization is a key feature which allows a defensible assumption of no confounding. However, another important but often overlooked advantage of RCTs is a well-defined intervention which allows clear causal contrasts to be made (e.g. enroll eligible persons and then give treatment A versus give treatment B). In observational analyses, a well-defined intervention, and the timing of assignment and assessment of eligibility for that intervention are not always aligned in a logical fashion.\n\n3)  Miguel Hernan is a leading expert on TTE and provides a short description of it here: [JAMA 2022](https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2022.21383). It is a two-step process; first defining the ideal RCT and how it can be emulated in the data, the second step is using TTE methods to perform that emulation (the focus of this guide).\n\n4)  Statistical analysis; depending on the approach used, the researcher will need to understand and execute logistic regression models, matching algorithms, and/or failure time (“survival”) analyses. Additionally, most of these methods do not have known statistical properties in the setting of TTE (due to duplicated data, weighting etc.) and so most applied researchers are using bootstrapping to generate uncertainty intervals. See Causal survival analysis (Chapter 17 of “What If” book linked above).\n\n## Acknowledgements {.unnumbered}\n\nThe tutorial represents my gathered and organized notes from research projects and didactic training.
