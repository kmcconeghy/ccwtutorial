## Clone-Censor-Weight  

This is a huge topic, and the main purpose of the guide. 

::: callout-note
I originally learned this as 'clone-censor-weight', but I am seeing 'cloning-censoring-weighting' also being used more frequently, I like the former.

## Sections {#sec-sections}

The [Introduction](ccw_01_intro.qmd) section reviews the basic target trial emulation protocol, treatment assignments and cloning. This is a key first step that establishes all the subsequent analytical choices. It is also very project specific, so what is done here may not generalize well to others. 

After establishing the TTE, the [Estimator](ccw_02_est.qmd) step is shown. This page simply goes through the procedure, but many aspects need to be interrogated for proper model specification, which is reviewed in [Diagnostics](ccw_04_diag.qmd). [Inference](ccw_03_inf.qmd) gives my personal approach for bootstrapping uncertainty estimates, there are a few choices for that (See [Bootstrapping](app_02_boot.qmd)).

## Applied examples in the literature:

My first CCW application was an evaluation of vaccine effects on all-cause death.[@McConeghy2024-me] 

Several other good examples are published.
