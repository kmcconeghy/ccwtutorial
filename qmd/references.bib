  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Vaccine hesitancy persists alongside concerns about
               the safety of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines. We
               aimed to examine the effect of COVID-19 vaccination on risk of
               death among US veterans. METHODS: We conducted a target trial
               emulation to estimate and compare risk of death up to 60 days
               under two COVID-19 vaccination strategies: vaccination within 7
               days of enrollment versus no vaccination through follow-up. The
               study cohort included individuals aged $\geq$18 years enrolled
               in the Veterans Health Administration system and eligible to
               receive a COVID-19 vaccination according to guideline
               recommendations from 1 March 2021 through 1 July 2021. The
               outcomes of interest included deaths from any cause and
               excluding a COVID-19 diagnosis. Observations were cloned to both
               treatment strategies, censored, and weighted to estimate
               per-protocol effects. RESULTS: We included 3 158 507 veterans.
               Under the vaccination strategy, 364 993 received vaccine within
               7 days. At 60 days, there were 156 deaths per 100 000 veterans
               under the vaccination strategy versus 185 deaths under the no
               vaccination strategy, corresponding to an absolute risk
               difference of -25.9 (95\% confidence limit [CL], -59.5 to 2.7)
               and relative risk of 0.86 (95\% CL, .7 to 1.0). When those with
               a COVID-19 infection in the first 60 days were censored, the
               absolute risk difference was -20.6 (95\% CL, -53.4 to 16.0) with
               a relative risk of 0.88 (95\% CL, .7 to 1.1). CONCLUSIONS:
               Vaccination against COVID-19 was associated with a lower but not
               statistically significantly different risk of death in the first
               60 days. These results agree with prior scientific knowledge
               suggesting vaccination is safe with the potential for
               substantial health benefits.",
