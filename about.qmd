# Preface to current version {.unnumbered}

The current tutorial version should show a basic start to finish example of the "Clone-Censor-Weight" approach. It is performed on a simulated dataset with no particular consideration for different types of confounding, or specialized cases etc. The tutorial will be updated when possible based on feedback, advances in science or as solutions to particular problems become known. 

*Some planned guides:*

1. Speeding up computation steps
2. Aggregation of continuous times into discrete intervals
3. Assessment of covariate balance in weighted sample
4. Covariate selection
